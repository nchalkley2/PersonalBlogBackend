								<h1>Creating the Davison Building Part 1</h1>
								<a href="../../img/screenshot.jpg">

								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p class="fp">
									<span class="sntc">This post is intended to provide an introspection into my workflow when I created the Davison building for the 3D-Atlanta project<sup class="citation" href="#cite_note-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> at Georgia State University.</span> <br> <br>
									<span class="sntc">I selected the Davison building as my first 3D Atlanta model because it was a simple building made with a few repeating elements, and because I was familiar with the building.</span> 
									<span class="sntc">The building is still standing and it's right outside the Peachtree Marta Station.</span> 
									<span class="sntc">I pass by it daily.</span> 
								</p>
								<hr>
								<h2>Gathering Reference</h2>
								<p class="fp">
									<span class="sntc">My SIF coworkers already gathered a lot of great reference from the 1920s, but I also visited the building in real life and shot reference images.</span> 
									<span class="sntc">Our collection of reference images we gathered online left a lot of blind spots, and it didn't capture as much detail as I needed.</span> 
									<span class="sntc">No one in the 1920s wanted to take a photo of the ass-end of the building, so I was lucky enough to be able to go out and do that myself.</span> 
								</p>

								</a>
								<p class="fp">
									<span class="sntc">One thing to note is that the building was actually expanded sometime after the 1920s.</span> 
									<span class="sntc">You can see that the side of the building is present in the modern pictures but not in the earlier ones.</span> 
								</p>

								<h2>Blockout</h2>
								<p class="fp">
									<span class="sntc">The blockout phase<sup class="citation" href="#cite_note-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> is where I spent most of my time when I made the Davison building.</span> 
									<span class="sntc">There's a few things that I tried to figure out in this phase: how to break building down into modular pieces, how to align the models to the grid, and how to match the models to the reference.</span> 
									<span class="sntc">To align the blockout to the reference I first set a reference image as a background image in 3ds Max, then I created a camera in the scene and used 3ds Max's perspective matching tool to align the camera's view to the reference picture I chose.</span>
								</p>

								</a>
								<p class="fp">
									<span class="sntc">Next, I placed a box primitive in the scene that was roughly the size of the building.</span> 
									<span class="sntc">I played around with dividing the box primitive into walls and modular windows, and I focused on finding a good size for the windows that would match both the reference and the grid.</span> 
								</p>
								<a href="../../img/window.jpg">
								<img class="inline-text" src="../../img/window.jpg" alt="Matching the models to the reference and the grid">
								</a>
								<p class="fp">	
									<span class="sntc">I settled on making the windows 512 units wide and 576 units tall.</span> 
									<span class="sntc">This dictated the size of the rest of my models, as I aligned almost everything to 512x512 squares.</span> 
									<span class="sntc">After I was satisfied with that, I finished blocking out the rest of the building.</span>

								<h2>Detailing</h2>
								<p class="fp">
									<span class="sntc">After blocking out the scene, I started to detail the scene.</span> 
									<span class="sntc">At this stage, I didn't care about the poly count of the models, as I was going for the maximum amount of detailing possible.</span> 
									<span class="sntc">I was planning on either replacing the higher poly models or baking the detail into textures.</span>
									<span class="sntc">For this phase, I used a lot of procedural modeling tools such as the Sweep Profile<sup class="citation" href="#cite_note-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> plugin.</span>
								</p>
								<a href="../../img/detailing_finished.jpg">
								<img class="inline-text" src="../../img/detailing_finished.jpg" alt="Finishing up the blockout">
								</a>
								<p class="fp">
									<span class="sntc">I use the plugin heavily when working with architectural pieces, as it's good for breaking up building designs.</span> 
									<span class="sntc">And, since it's a spline modifier, it's easy to jump back and forth between the spline and the high poly, detailed model.</span>

								<h2>Part 2</h2>
								<p class="fp">
									<span class="sntc">In the next part, I explain my modular texturing workflow, which shows how I worked from a texture atlas to create highly detailed models and allow high texture reuse.</span> <br><br>
									<span class="sntc">Coming soon...</span>
